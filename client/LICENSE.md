## 2. Grant of License

2.1 **Non-Commercial Use License**:  
The Original Author grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-commercial license to use, reproduce, and modify the Software. You may also distribute the Software and any modifications, subject to the terms in Section 3 (Source Code Requirements) and Section 4 (Non-Commercial Restriction).

2.2 **Visibility and Distribution**:  
You may publicly host, display, and share the Software on platforms such as GitHub, provided the source code is openly available under this License. The Software should remain visible and accessible without charge, except for ordinary access fees charged by internet service providers.

Any form of distribution of the Software or a modified version (Derived Work) must include complete source code, released under the terms of this License.

4.2 **Donations for Server Costs Only**:

No funds derived from the Software or its distribution may be used for any purpose other than covering these infrastructure-related expenses.

## 5. Contributions and Ownership

5.1 **Contribution Approval**:  
No one may incorporate a Contribution into the official codebase without explicit, written approval from the Original Author. If a proposed Contribution is accepted, the Contributor is subject to the conditions below.

5.2 **Basic Contributors**:  
By submitting a Contribution and having it accepted without further agreements, a Basic Contributor grants all copyrights in their Contribution to the Original Author. The Basic Contributor retains moral rights and is credited as the author of that code, but holds no ownership or special approval rights over future changes.

5.3 **Co-Owner Contributors**:  
A Contributor may request or be offered the status of Co-Owner Contributor. If granted in writing by the Original Author, the Co-Owner Contributor retains joint copyright ownership of their accepted Contribution. Co-Owners may have a voice in major licensing changes and certain critical decisions if explicitly agreed upon in a separate co-ownership agreement.

- Co-Owners must comply with all terms of this License; if they violate its terms, their co-ownership status and rights under this License may be terminated.

  Co-ownership is never automatic. It must be explicitly granted by the Original Author. Without such explicit grant, the Contributor is considered a Basic Contributor.

If a non-co-owner User violates any terms of this License, their right to use, modify, and distribute the Software may be revoked at the discretion of the Original Author. Continued use after a violation may subject them to legal action under applicable law.

6.2 **Co-Owners**:  
If a Co-Owner violates this License, their co-ownership and all associated rights immediately terminate. They revert to having no special rights beyond what any ordinary User would have under this License (unless otherwise determined by the Original Author and any applicable co-ownership agreement).

## 9. Amendments

This License may be updated by the Original Author. Major changes to the terms affecting co-owners may require their agreement per any separate co-ownership agreement. Any updated license shall be publicly posted. Continued use of the Software after license updates constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.
